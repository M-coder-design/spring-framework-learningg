Explanation of Autowiring by Name:


How It Works:
Spring looks for a property (in this case, engine) in the Car bean.
It then tries to find a bean with an ID that matches the name of the property (engine in this case).
If it finds such a bean, it automatically injects it into the Car bean.


Why It Works:
In the Car class, the property engine is set through a setter method (setEngine()).
In the Spring XML configuration, the autowire="byName" attribute tells Spring to match the name of the Car bean's property with the ID of the Engine bean.


Important Notes:
Autowiring by Name vs Autowiring by Type: Autowiring by name is more restrictive than autowiring by type because it relies on the property name matching the bean name. Autowiring by type (which uses autowire="byType") is often preferred because it allows Spring to inject the appropriate bean by matching the type of the property.

No Matching Bean: If there is no bean in the context that matches the name of the property, Spring will throw an exception at runtime, as it will not be able to autowire the dependency.
