How It Works:
Autowiring by Type: The autowire="byType" configuration tells Spring to look for a bean that matches the type of the property (Engine in this case). Since there is a bean of type Engine (id="engine"), Spring automatically injects this Engine bean into the Car bean’s setEngine() method.

Matching by Type: The Car bean’s property engine is of type Engine. Spring looks for a bean of type Engine and injects it if there’s exactly one matching bean in the context.

Important Notes:
Matching by Type: When autowiring by type, Spring looks for a bean of the exact type (or compatible type) to inject. In this case, it looks for a bean of type Engine.

No Matching Bean: If there is no matching bean in the Spring context for the required type, Spring will throw an exception (NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException if multiple beans of the same type are found, or NoSuchBeanDefinitionException if no bean of the required type is found).

Multiple Beans of Same Type: If there are multiple beans of the same type, Spring will not know which one to inject, leading to an exception. In such cases, you should either:

Use @Qualifier (if using annotations) to specify which bean to inject.
Use autowire="byName" or autowire="constructor" for more explicit dependency resolution.
